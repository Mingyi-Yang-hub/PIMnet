# VQE
This work is for video quality enhancement.
We design a learning based post-processing network to enhance the quality of the compressed videos.
We proposed to use use the Quantization Parameter (QP) and Delta Picture Order Count (POC) of multiple input frames in the compressed video to modulate the post-processing network, where QP can reflect the quality of frames and POC can reflect the temporal distance between neighboring frames and the current frame.
